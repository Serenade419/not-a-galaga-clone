# not-a-galaga-clone
Really because it doesn't feel like it. I've tried for many days to upscale from one of my previous versions for this app and none of them
ended up really working out for me. So in the end here is a simple version of the one that I ended up working to be able to host using Node.


## Description
A Basic attempt to recreate Galaga a known late 1980's game virtually on arcade machines. Using javascript and its canvas API it was sort of used
to replicated for web use without needing to be locally hosted but of course, now were here? Anyways many of the features of the code produced
has been difficult to manage simply because everything was originally in one file.

Use npm install and npm start to run the files from the main directory.


## FYI
All asset files were taken from online sources and not from any properties containing disclosed information or designs. If need be for any take downs
let me know, I am not aware of any sort of current property rights that may be violated.

Should also be noted that there are a ton of issues with the current program and at this point is more like a visual of what was done here.
